## Ticktofix

Executive Summary
Ticktofix is a web application that will allow tenants, commercial or residential to submit repair tickets to the superintendents or building management for repairs and more. In the ticket, a client can submit a thorough description of their needs or problems. A superintendent or manager can login to Ticktofix to assign, update and close tickets. Crew members will complete work, add detail notes to their ticket, add their time. Another possibility, maybe for the future is the ability that client can comment, review, or even rate the work completed. 

This idea came as we realize the many challenges we face as tenants to get a hold of a super and maintenance crew. Some of the issues: time, coordinating, lack of understanding, lack of accountability and more. A ticketing system helps clear such things out.

Our target user is anyone who are landlords, commercial and residential buildings. As far as the need, there is definitely a need for this kind of service in metropolitan areas and large cities. New York is a prime example. Such a service is rarely available. Most of the interaction for repair happens by calling and speaking to someone and trusting(hoping) they are writing it down. Most of the time, they are not.

There are many ticketing systems out there, most are in areas of technical support, phone support, customer service. Our product differs as we are trying to reach a special segment where technology hasn’t really reached. Our app will make it easy for anyone to simply login, submit a ticket, submit available time and monitor the progress. This isn’t available anywhere at the moment. Even offices have to make calls to management just to get the maintenance crew to complete repairs. Many many calls. Out with that, in with Ticktofix.
